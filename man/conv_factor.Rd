\usage{
conv_factor(df, factor_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data table in which to convert factor columns}

\item{factor_cols}{columns to be converted to a factor}
}
\value{
a data table
}
\description{
Convert factor columns
}
\details{
This function \bold{modifies by reference}.
This function checks for which columns to factor by comparing against a character vector called \code{factor_cols}.
The function then fetches a variable from the calling environment with the same name as the column being converted to a factor.
This variable should reference a named list specifying how to rename the levels (see \code{\link[nsqipr:factorpipe]{\%^\%}}
for further details).
